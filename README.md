In rust we trust, for everything else there is duct tape.


### Design principles
* Modular
  Each project should be broken down to modules, swapping out one module should not effect another module.
* Assessible parts
  Wherever possible using parts that are cheep and commonly avaliable.
* Hackable
  Parts and modules should be easy to modify without any 'black boxes'.
